## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)  
- npm (v9 or higher)  
- Git  
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)  

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haxous742/Hostel-Management-System.git
   cd Hostel-Management-System
   ```

2. **Set Up Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:

   For the simplicity of the installations, we have given out our API keys in the `./env` file. We understand that this is not a good practice.

   - In one terminal, run frontend:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm run dev
     ```
     Visit: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

   - In another terminal, run backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     node index.js
     ```
     API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

   -ID and pass for admin are "admin" and "password" respectively.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Implementation Overview

This project has been structured with modularity, clarity, and scalability in mind.

### üöÄ Frontend (React + Tailwind + Flowbite)

- **Folder Structure**: Pages are componentized by feature (e.g., Dashboard, LeaveForm, Complaints, Profile).
- **Routing**: React Router DOM is used to manage navigation between pages, with protected routes for authentication.
- **Community Feed**: Uses context API for shared state of posts and real-time display of top 3 in dashboard.
- **Mess Rating**: Users can give feedback through star ratings; data is synced to the backend.
- **Forms**: Complaint and Leave forms include field validation, dynamic dropdowns, and submit state UX improvements.

### üß∞ Backend (Node.js + Express)

- **Authentication**:
  - JWT tokens are used for secure authentication.
  - Middleware checks for user roles (admin/student) to manage access control.
- **OTP System**:
  - `nodemailer` is integrated to send OTPs to parent email IDs during leave applications.
  - OTPs are hashed and time-limited to enhance security.
- **Leave System**:
  - Two MongoDB collections handle temporary (unverified) and verified leaves.
  - Once OTP is confirmed, the leave is moved to a permanent schema.
- **Complaint Management**:
  - Complaints are stored in MongoDB with `status`, `type`, and `studentId`.
  - Admin routes allow toggling complaint resolution status.

## üß© Database & Data Models

This project uses **MongoDB** as its database, with **Mongoose** for modeling application data.

The following models are used to structure and manage data:

- **users_model.js**: Master schema storing student registration, login info, parent email, profile photo, and more.
- **complaints_model.js**: Handles student-submitted complaints with fields like `type`, `message`, `status`, and `studentId`.
- **leave_model.js**: Stores verified leave requests post OTP approval with details like `reason`, `type`, `departure`, and `return`.
- **tempLeave_model.js**: Captures temporary leave forms waiting for OTP verification.
- **menu_model.js**: Contains the mess menu data for each day; used for daily display and rating sync.
- **post_model.js**: Holds community post info ‚Äî text, image, hashtags, timestamp, and author metadata.
- **rating_model.js**: Stores mess food ratings submitted by users for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
- **userVote_model.js**: Tracks user upvotes/downvotes on community posts to ensure one vote per user per post.

Each schema includes:
- Validation rules
- Default timestamps
- Indexes (for some models like posts or complaints) to enhance query performance

These models are interlinked through references (e.g., `studentId` in complaints refers to a user) to maintain consistency and enforce data relations.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Admin Panel

- Admin can see lists of all active complaints and pending leave applications.
- One-click approval or rejection of leaves.
